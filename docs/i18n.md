# Internationalization (i18n) Design

## Current Approach

- The CMS uses JSON-based translation files under `labels/`.
- `ja.json` is treated as the source of truth for translation keys.
- `en.json` is actively maintained for daily operation.
- Other language files (e.g. `hi.json`, `id.json`) exist but are not fully maintained.

## Design Rationale

At the current stage of the project:
- The system is single-tenant or lightly multi-tenant.
- UI text is relatively stable.
- There is no dedicated translation or localization workflow.

Therefore, database-backed translations are intentionally not implemented.

JSON-based translations provide:
- Simplicity
- Version control via Git
- Predictable behavior
- Low operational overhead

## Future Considerations

A database-backed i18n system may be introduced if:
- The system becomes fully multi-tenant
- Clients require custom wording per tenant
- Non-developers need to edit translations
- Translation workflow (review, approval, audit) is required

A recommended future model is:
1. JSON files as base translations
2. Database overrides per tenant + language + key

## Status

This design decision is intentional and not a technical limitation.
